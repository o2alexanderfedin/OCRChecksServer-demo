# GitFlow Release Management Rules

## Overview

This document establishes the proper GitFlow release process based on successful implementation of the CloudflareLlama33JsonExtractor release (v1.60.0). It covers the complete workflow from feature completion through production deployment.

## GitFlow Release Process

### 1. Pre-Release Preparation

#### Ensure All Features Are Complete
```bash
# Verify all features are merged to develop
git checkout develop
git status  # Should be clean
git log --oneline -10  # Review recent commits
```

#### Clean Up Existing Release Branches
```bash
# Check for existing release branches
git branch -a | grep release

# If old release branches exist, clean them up
git branch -D release/old-version  # Delete problematic local branches
```

#### Verify Implementation Completeness
- All GitHub project issues marked as "Done"
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated
- No pending feature work

### 2. Start Release Process

#### Create Release Branch
```bash
# Start new release (follow semantic versioning)
git flow release start X.Y.Z

# Example: git flow release start 1.60.0
```

#### Update Version Numbers
```bash
# Update package.json version
sed -i 's/"version": "X.Y.Z-old"/"version": "X.Y.Z"/' package.json

# Verify the change
grep '"version"' package.json
```

### 3. Release Documentation

#### Create Release Summary
Create comprehensive release documentation in `docs/releases/release-summary-vX.Y.Z.md`:

**Required Sections:**
- Release Overview
- Architecture Highlights  
- Implementation Details
- Testing Infrastructure
- Key Features
- New Files Added
- Configuration Changes
- Performance Metrics

### 5. Complete Release Process

#### Finish Release with Proper Tagging
```bash
# Finish the release (this merges to main and develop, creates tag)
git flow release finish X.Y.Z
```

**If tagging fails:**
```bash
# Create tag manually with comprehensive message
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z: [Feature Name] Implementation

🚀 Major Release Features:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

```

### 6. Push Changes to Remote

#### Push All Branches and Tags
```bash
# Push main branch
git push origin main

# Push develop branch  
git push origin develop

# Push tags
git push --tags
```

#### Verify Remote State
```bash
# Verify tags are pushed
git ls-remote --tags origin

# Verify branches are updated
git ls-remote --heads origin
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Existing Release Branch
**Problem**: `There is an existing release branch (X.Y.Z). Finish that one first.`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check what's in the existing release
git checkout release/X.Y.Z
git log --oneline -5

# If it's outdated/problematic, delete it
git checkout develop
git branch -D release/X.Y.Z

# Then start new release
git flow release start X.Y.Z
```

### Issue: Tag Already Exists
**Problem**: `fatal: tag 'vX.Y.Z' already exists`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check existing tag
git tag -l "vX.Y.Z"
git show vX.Y.Z

# If tag is correct, skip manual tagging
# If tag needs updating, delete and recreate
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z  # Delete remote tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Updated release message"
git push --tags
```

### Issue: Tagging Failed During Release Finish
**Problem**: `fatal: no tag message? Tagging failed. Please run finish again to retry.`

**Solution**:
```bash
# The merge to main succeeded, just need to create tag manually
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release message"
git push --tags
```

## Version Number Guidelines

### Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes, new architecture, major features
- **MINOR**: New features, significant enhancements, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, small improvements, maintenance

### Examples from Project History
- `1.59.9` → `1.60.0`: Major feature addition (CloudflareLlama33JsonExtractor)
- `1.60.0` → `1.60.1`: Bug fixes and improvements
- `1.60.1` → `1.61.0`: New feature addition

mutation {
  updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(
    input: {
      projectId: "PROJECT_ID"
      itemId: "ITEM_ID"
      fieldId: "STATUS_FIELD_ID"
      value: { singleSelectOptionId: "DONE_OPTION_ID" }
    }
  ) {
    projectV2Item { id }
  }
}'
```

### Verification
```bash
# Verify all issues are marked as Done
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  organization(login: "ORG_NAME") {
    projectV2(number: 1) {
      items(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          content {
            ... on Issue {
              number
              title
            }
          }
          fieldValues(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue {
                name
                field {
                  ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField {
                    name
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check GitFlow status
git flow version

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Check remote status
git remote -v
git fetch --all

# Check tag status
git tag -l | sort -V | tail -5

# Check recent releases
ls -la docs/releases/
```

### Recovery Commands
```bash
# Reset to develop if release fails
git checkout develop
git reset --hard origin/develop

# Clean up failed release
git branch -D release/X.Y.Z
git tag -d vX.Y.Z 2>/dev/null || true

# Restart release process
git flow release start X.Y.Z
```

## Success Criteria

A successful GitFlow release should result in:

1. **Clean Branch State**: Main and develop branches updated
2. **Proper Tagging**: Version tag created with comprehensive message
3. **Complete Documentation**: Release summary with all required sections
4. **Project Completion**: All GitHub issues marked as Done
5. **Remote Synchronization**: All changes pushed to origin
6. **Version Consistency**: package.json version matches tag
7. **No Regressions**: All existing functionality preserved

## Future Improvements
