## API Usage

The OCR Checks Worker provides three main processing endpoints and a health status endpoint:

### Dedicated Endpoints

#### Check Processing

Send a POST request to the dedicated check endpoint with a check image:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
  --data-binary @check.jpg \
  https://your-worker.workers.dev/check
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkNumber": "1234",
    "date": "2023-09-15",
    "payee": "John Doe",
    "amount": 250.00,
    "payer": "ABC Company",
    "bankName": "First National Bank",
    "routingNumber": "123456789",
    "accountNumber": "987654321",
    "memo": "Invoice #1001"
  },
  "confidence": {
    "ocr": 0.92,
    "extraction": 0.85,
    "overall": 0.78
  }
}
```

#### Receipt Processing

Send a POST request to the dedicated receipt endpoint with a receipt image:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
  --data-binary @receipt.jpg \
  https://your-worker.workers.dev/receipt
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "merchant": {
      "name": "Grocery Store Inc.",
      "address": "123 Main St., Anytown, CA 90210",
      "phone": "555-123-4567"
    },
    "timestamp": "2023-09-15T14:30:00Z",
    "items": [
      { "description": "Organic Apples", "quantity": 2, "unitPrice": 1.99, "totalPrice": 3.98 },
      { "description": "Whole Grain Bread", "quantity": 1, "unitPrice": 3.49, "totalPrice": 3.49 }
    ],
    "totals": {
      "subtotal": 7.47,
      "tax": 0.65,
      "tip": 0.00,
      "total": 8.12
    },
    "payment": {
      "method": "CREDIT_CARD",
      "cardLastFour": "1234"
    }
  },
  "confidence": {
    "ocr": 0.89,
    "extraction": 0.82,
    "overall": 0.73
  }
}
```

### Universal Document Processing

Use the unified processing endpoint with the document type parameter:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
  --data-binary @check.jpg \
  https://your-worker.workers.dev/process?type=check
```

The universal endpoint provides the same functionality as the dedicated endpoints but includes an additional `documentType` field in the response:

```json
{
  "data": { /* document data */ },
  "documentType": "check",
  "confidence": {
    "ocr": 0.92,
    "extraction": 0.85,
    "overall": 0.78
  }
}
```

### Health Status

Check the service status and version:

```bash
curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-02T12:34:56.789Z",
  "version": "1.12.2"
}
```

> **Important**: The root endpoint (`/`) has been removed in version 1.12.0. Please use the dedicated endpoints described above.

### JSON Extraction Example

```javascript
import { MistralJsonExtractorProvider } from './src/json/mistral';
import { Mistral } from '@mistralai/mistralai';
import { workerIoE } from './src/io';

// Initialize the JSON extractor
const mistralClient = new Mistral({ apiKey: process.env.MISTRAL_API_KEY });
const jsonExtractor = new MistralJsonExtractorProvider(workerIoE, mistralClient);

// Define a schema for check data
const checkSchema = {
  name: "CheckSchema",
  schemaDefinition: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      checkNumber: { type: "string" },
      date: { type: "string" },
      payee: { type: "string" },
      amount: { type: "number" },
      memo: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["checkNumber", "date", "payee", "amount"]
  }
};

// Process OCR output with JSON extraction
async function processCheckWithOCR(imageBuffer) {
  // Step 1: Perform OCR on the check image
  const ocrResult = await ocrProvider.processDocuments([{
    content: imageBuffer,
    type: DocumentType.Image
  }]);
  
  if (ocrResult[0] === 'error') {
    return { error: 'OCR processing failed' };
  }
  
  // Step 2: Extract JSON data from OCR text
  const markdownText = ocrResult[1][0][0].text;
  const jsonResult = await jsonExtractor.extract({
    markdown: markdownText,
    schema: checkSchema
  });
  
  if (jsonResult[0] === 'error') {
    return { error: 'JSON extraction failed' };
  }
  
  // Step 3: Return structured data with confidence score
  return {
    data: jsonResult[1].json,
    confidence: jsonResult[1].confidence,
    rawText: markdownText
  };
}
```

## Development

To run locally:
```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

### Schema Documentation

The following JSON schemas are available:

- **Check Schema**: For extracting data from paper checks
- **Receipt Schema**: For extracting data from purchase receipts

For detailed schema documentation, see:
- [Check Schema Documentation](docs/check-schema-documentation.md)
- [Receipt Schema Documentation](docs/receipt-schema-documentation.md)

### Testing Infrastructure

The project uses a comprehensive testing approach with multiple distinct test types:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
   ```bash
   npm run test:unit
   ```

2. **Functional Tests**: Test functions and interactions with a functional programming approach
   ```bash
   npm run test:functional
   ```

3. **Semi-Integration Tests**: Test components against real external services
   ```bash
   npm run test:semi
   ```

4. **Integration Tests**: Full end-to-end tests of the API
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration
   ```

5. **Receipt Scanner Tests**: Specific tests for the receipt scanning functionality
   ```bash
   npm run test:receipt-scanner
   ```

6. **Swift Proxy E2E Tests**: End-to-end tests for the Swift client library that verify it can communicate with a real server instance
   ```bash
   npm run test:swift-e2e
   ```

7. **Version Testing**: Verify deployed versions match source code across all environments
   ```bash
   # Test all environments with auto-discovery
   npm run test:version:dynamic
   
   # Test specific environments
   npm run test:version:production
   npm run test:version:staging
   npm run test:version:dev
   ```

8. **Smoke Tests**: Quick health checks and basic functionality verification
   ```bash
   # Enhanced smoke tests with dynamic version checking
   npm run test:smoke
   
   # Environment-specific smoke tests
   npm run test:smoke:production
   npm run test:smoke:dev
   ```

#### Dynamic URL Discovery

The testing infrastructure includes automatic Cloudflare Worker URL discovery:

```bash
# Discover all environment URLs from Cloudflare
npx tsx scripts/get-cloudflare-urls.ts

# Test version across all discovered environments
npm run test:version:dynamic

# Output discovered URLs in different formats
npx tsx scripts/get-cloudflare-urls.ts --format json
npx tsx scripts/get-cloudflare-urls.ts --format env
```

**Features:**
- **Automatic URL Discovery**: No hardcoded URLs needed
- **Multi-Environment Testing**: Test local, dev, staging, and production simultaneously
- **Version Verification**: Ensures deployed version matches `package.json`
- **Health Monitoring**: Checks service status and API key configuration

Run all tests together:
```bash
npm test
```

> Note: The Swift proxy E2E tests require Swift to be installed on your system. These tests will automatically start a local server, run the tests, and shut down the server when complete.

### Client Libraries

#### Swift Client Library

The Swift client library is now maintained as a separate Git submodule. This provides a clean Swift package that can be used independently in iOS and macOS applications.

Key features of the Swift client:
- Modern Swift concurrency with async/await support
- Backward compatibility with completion handlers
- Type-safe models for check and receipt data
- Automatic HEIC image conversion to PNG
- Comprehensive error handling
- Environment configuration (development, staging, production)

For more information on working with the Swift submodule, see the [Swift Submodule Guide](./docs/swift-submodule-guide.md).

#### NolockCapture Package

The NolockCapture package provides advanced document capture capabilities with depth sensing support to improve OCR accuracy by flattening curved documents.

Key features of NolockCapture:
- Depth-aware document capture using LiDAR or dual cameras
- 3D point cloud processing for document plane detection
- Automatic perspective correction for curved documents
- Surface flattening to improve OCR accuracy
- Progressive enhancement with fallbacks for non-LiDAR devices

For more information on working with the NolockCapture submodule, see the [NolockCapture Guide](./docs/nolock-capture-guide.md).

### Test Server Management

Starting from version 1.12.1, the test server is properly managed with improved process tracking:

- Server processes are tracked using a PID file
- Server is automatically shut down after tests complete
- No more "zombie" server processes after tests
- Proper signal handling for clean termination
- Enhanced error reporting and logging
