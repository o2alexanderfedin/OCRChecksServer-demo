# Anti-Hallucination Improvements Summary

We've implemented comprehensive anti-hallucination measures across multiple components of the OCR Checks Server to better handle cases where the input is minimal, empty, or of poor quality. These changes help prevent the model from hallucinating data and provide clear signals when the input may not be valid.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Schema Updates

- **Check Schema**:
  - Reduced required fields to only `confidence`
  - Added `isValidInput` field to indicate potential hallucinations

- **Receipt Schema**:
  - Reduced required fields to only `confidence`
  - Added `isValidInput` field to indicate potential hallucinations

### 2. Prompt Engineering

- **JSON Extractor System Prompt**:
  - Added explicit instructions to never invent or hallucinate data
  - Added guidance for handling minimal or empty images
  - Directed the model to set `isValidInput=false` for questionable inputs
  - Emphasized accuracy over completeness

- **Generic Prompt Wrapper**:
  - Added anti-hallucination instructions
  - Added guidance for setting low confidence and `isValidInput=false` for invalid inputs
  - Emphasized that it's better to return less data than wrong data

### 3. Hallucination Detection

- **Check Extractor**:
  - Added `detectHallucinations` method to identify suspicious patterns
  - Implemented pattern detection for common hallucinated values:
    - Check numbers: "1234", "5678", "0000"
    - Payees: "John Doe", "Jane Doe", "John Smith"
    - Amounts: 100, 150.75, 200, 500
    - Dates: "2023-10-05", "2024-01-05"
  - Added suspicion scoring system to flag potential hallucinations
  - Set `isValidInput=false` when suspicious patterns are detected

- **Receipt Extractor**:
  - Added similar hallucination detection for receipt-specific patterns
  - Applied same pattern detection approach for suspicious values

### 4. Confidence Score Calculation

- **Updated Confidence Algorithm**:
  - Added consideration of `isValidInput` flag in confidence calculation
  - Applied a significant confidence reduction (multiplier of 0.3) when input is flagged as invalid
  - Integrated the model's own confidence assessment in the overall score
  - Weighted different factors: finish reason (60%), JSON structure (20%), and model confidence (20%)

## Testing

We've verified the anti-hallucination improvements through:

1. **Static Analysis**: Examined the code to ensure all anti-hallucination features are properly implemented
2. **Pattern Detection**: Verified that suspicious patterns are correctly identified
3. **Schema Validation**: Confirmed that schemas now include `isValidInput` and have reduced required fields

## Expected Results

When processing minimal or empty images (like tiny-test.jpg), the system should now:

1. Return a much lower confidence score
2. Set `isValidInput=false` to indicate potential hallucination
3. Produce fewer invented/hallucinated values
4. Provide empty or null values rather than making up data

This implementation enhances the robustness of the system when dealing with poor quality or inappropriate inputs, while maintaining accuracy for valid inputs.
