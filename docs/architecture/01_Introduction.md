## Purpose

This document describes the architecture of the OCR Checks Server system in detail. It provides a comprehensive view of the architectural design decisions, component structure, deployment model, and runtime behavior of the system. The document serves as:

1. A reference for developers working on the system
2. A guide for maintainers and operators
3. A technical overview for stakeholders and new team members
4. Documentation of key architectural decisions and their rationales

## Scope

The OCR Checks Server is a Cloudflare Worker-based system that performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on paper checks and receipts using Mistral AI's vision capabilities. The system:

- Accepts image uploads of checks and receipts
- Processes images using AI-based OCR
- Extracts structured data from the OCR results
- Returns standardized JSON responses
- Provides confidence scores for extracted data
- Offers client libraries for integration

This architecture document covers the complete system architecture, including the core server, client libraries, and deployment infrastructure. It describes both the current implementation and planned future extensions.

## Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders of this architecture document are:

| Stakeholder | Concerns |
|-------------|----------|
| **Development Team** | Implementation guidelines, component structure, technical decisions |
| **Operations Team** | Deployment processes, monitoring strategy, scaling approach |
| **Product Owners** | System capabilities, integration options, extension points |
| **Client Developers** | API specifications, client library usage, integration patterns |
| **QA Team** | Test coverage, validation mechanisms, error handling |
| **Security Team** | Authentication methods, data protection, API security |

## System Context

The OCR Checks Server operates within a larger ecosystem of services and client applications:
