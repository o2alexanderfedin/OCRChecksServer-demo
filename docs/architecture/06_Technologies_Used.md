    Alt1[Go] -->|Drawbacks| Alt1D[Less Worker Integration]
    Alt2[Rust] -->|Drawbacks| Alt2D[Higher Learning Curve]
    Alt3[Python] -->|Drawbacks| Alt3D[Not Directly Supported on Workers]
```

TypeScript was chosen over alternatives because:
- First-class support in Cloudflare Workers environment
- Strong typing system for maintainable code
- Large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks

- Optimized for edge computing and Cloudflare Workers
- Minimal footprint and high performance
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Middleware system compatible with Workers environment

### InversifyJS vs. Other DI Solutions

InversifyJS was chosen over other dependency injection solutions because:

- Active maintenance and community support

### Cloudflare Workers vs. Other Platforms

```mermaid
graph TD
    CF[Cloudflare Workers] -->|Benefits| CF1[Global Edge Distribution]
    CF -->|Benefits| CF2[No Server Management]
    CF -->|Benefits| CF3[High Performance]
    CF -->|Benefits| CF4[Automatic Scaling]
    
    Alt1[AWS Lambda] -->|Drawbacks| Alt1D[Cold Start Latency]
    Alt2[Azure Functions] -->|Drawbacks| Alt2D[More Complex Management]
