## Terminology

### A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**  
A set of defined rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In the OCR Checks Server, the API provides endpoints for document processing and health monitoring.

**API Key**  
A unique identifier used for authentication to access the Mistral AI service. The OCR Checks Server uses an API key to authenticate with the Mistral AI API for OCR and data extraction.

**Authentication**  
The process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or application. The OCR Checks Server uses API key authentication for service access.

**Authorization**  
The process of determining access rights to resources. The OCR Checks Server implements basic authorization through API key validation.

### B

**Base64**  
An encoding scheme that converts binary data into ASCII string format. The OCR Checks Server uses Base64 encoding for image data transmission.

### C

**Check**  
A paper document used as a financial instrument to instruct a bank to pay a specific amount from a specific account. The OCR Checks Server processes check images and extracts structured data from them.

**Cloudflare Worker**  
A serverless execution environment that runs on Cloudflare's global edge network. The OCR Checks Server is deployed as a Cloudflare Worker.

**Confidence Score**  
A numerical value indicating the system's confidence in the accuracy of extracted data. The OCR Checks Server provides confidence scores for OCR, extraction, and overall processing.

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**  
A security feature that controls how web resources can be requested from different domains. The OCR Checks Server implements CORS headers to enable browser-based access.

### D

**Data Extraction**  
The process of identifying and retrieving specific data from unstructured content. The OCR Checks Server extracts structured data from OCR text using Mistral AI.

**Dependency Injection (DI)**  
A design pattern that implements inversion of control for resolving dependencies. The OCR Checks Server uses InversifyJS for dependency injection.

**DI Container**  
A software component that manages the instantiation of dependent objects. The OCR Checks Server uses a custom DIContainer class to manage component dependencies.

**Document Type**  
The category of document being processed, such as check or receipt. The OCR Checks Server supports different document types with specialized processing pipelines.

### E

**Edge Computing**  
A distributed computing paradigm that brings computation closer to the data source. Cloudflare Workers provides edge computing capabilities for the OCR Checks Server.

**Endpoint**  
A specific URL within an API that accepts requests and returns responses. The OCR Checks Server provides endpoints for check processing, receipt processing, and health monitoring.

**Extraction**  
The process of identifying and extracting structured data from unstructured content. The OCR Checks Server extracts data from OCR text using Mistral AI.

### F

**Factory Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. The OCR Checks Server uses a ScannerFactory to create scanner instances.

### G

**GitFlow**  
A branching model for Git that defines a strict branching strategy designed around project releases. The OCR Checks Server development follows the GitFlow workflow.

### H

**HEIC (High Efficiency Image Format)**  
An image container format for storing images and image sequences. The OCR Checks Server supports HEIC images and converts them for processing.

**Health Check**  
An endpoint or process that verifies the operational status of a system. The OCR Checks Server provides a `/health` endpoint for monitoring system status.

**Hono**  
A lightweight web framework for edge computing platforms. The OCR Checks Server uses Hono for API routing and middleware.

### I

**InversifyJS**  
A lightweight dependency injection container for TypeScript applications. The OCR Checks Server uses InversifyJS for dependency management.

**IoE (Input/Output with Errors)**  
A custom interface in the OCR Checks Server for logging and error handling.

### J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**  
A lightweight data interchange format based on JavaScript object syntax. The OCR Checks Server returns responses in JSON format.

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**  
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between parties. Not currently used in the OCR Checks Server but considered for future authentication enhancements.

### L

**Logging**  
The process of recording application events, errors, and activities. The OCR Checks Server implements logging through the IoE interface.

### M

**Middleware**  
Software components that act as intermediaries between different parts of an application. The OCR Checks Server uses middleware for CORS, validation, and error handling.

**Mistral AI**  
An AI service provider used for OCR and data extraction. The OCR Checks Server integrates with Mistral AI for document processing.

### O

**OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**  
The conversion of images of text into machine-encoded text. The OCR Checks Server uses Mistral AI for OCR processing of document images.

**OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)**  
A specification for building and documenting RESTful APIs. The OCR Checks Server provides OpenAPI documentation through Swagger UI.

### R

**Receipt**  
A document acknowledging the purchase of goods or services. The OCR Checks Server processes receipt images and extracts structured data from them.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**  
An architectural style for designing networked applications. The OCR Checks Server provides a RESTful API for document processing.

**Result Type**  
A pattern for handling operations that might fail by representing the result as either a success or failure value. The OCR Checks Server uses a tuple-based Result type for error handling.

### S

**Scanner**  
A component in the OCR Checks Server that orchestrates the document processing workflow. Specialized scanners exist for different document types.

**Schema**  
A formal definition of the structure and constraints of data. The OCR Checks Server uses Zod schemas for data validation.

**Serverless**  
A cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure. The OCR Checks Server is deployed as a serverless application on Cloudflare Workers.

**Stateless**  
A design approach where no client session information is stored between requests. The OCR Checks Server is designed as a stateless system.

**Swagger UI**  
An interactive API documentation tool. The OCR Checks Server provides Swagger UI for API exploration and documentation.

### T

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)**  
A cryptographic protocol that provides secure communications over a computer network. The OCR Checks Server uses TLS for secure API communications.

**TypeScript**  
A programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript. The OCR Checks Server is implemented in TypeScript.

### V

**V8 Isolate**  
A JavaScript execution context in the V8 engine. Cloudflare Workers uses V8 Isolates for executing the OCR Checks Server code.

**Validation**  
The process of ensuring data meets specified requirements. The OCR Checks Server implements validation for API inputs and extracted data.

### W

**Wrangler**  
Cloudflare's command-line tool for managing Workers. The OCR Checks Server uses Wrangler for development and deployment.

### Z

**Zod**  
A TypeScript-first schema validation library. The OCR Checks Server uses Zod for schema definition and validation.
