## Task Selection Algorithm in Practice

### Day 1 Decision Matrix

| Task | Priority | Dependencies | Story Points | Ready? | Selection Order |
|------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| #6 | High | None | 3 | ‚úÖ Yes | **1st** |
| #7 | High | None | 3 | ‚úÖ Yes | **2nd** |
| #8 | Critical | #6, #7 | 3 | ‚ùå No | Wait |
| #9 | Medium | #8 | 3 | ‚ùå No | Wait |

**Decision**: Start #6 and #7 simultaneously (parallel work possible)

### Day 3 Decision Matrix

| Task | Priority | Dependencies | Status | Ready? | Selection Order |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| #6 | High | None | Done ‚úÖ | N/A | Completed |
| #7 | High | None | In Progress | N/A | Continue |
| #8 | Critical | #6‚úÖ, #7üîÑ | Todo | üîÑ Partial | **Next** |
| #9 | Medium | #8 | Todo | ‚ùå No | Wait |

**Decision**: Start #8 as #7 is nearly complete and #6 provides necessary utility

### Daily Kanban Standup Example

**Day 5 Standup:**

**Developer A** (#6 - AntiHallucinationDetector):
- **Yesterday**: Completed unit tests, merged feature branch
- **Today**: Starting #8 (main extractor implementation)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Status**: #6 Todo ‚Üí Done ‚úÖ

**Developer B** (#7 - ConfidenceCalculator):
- **Yesterday**: Finished implementation, running integration tests
- **Today**: Final review and merge, then available for #9
- **Blockers**: None
- **Status**: #7 In Progress ‚Üí Done ‚úÖ

**Developer C** (Available):
- **Yesterday**: Code review for #6 and #7
- **Today**: Can start #9 (DI configuration) once #8 begins
- **Blockers**: Waiting for #8 to start
- **Status**: Ready for next task

## WIP Limits and Flow Control

### Current WIP Status
```
Todo: #9, #10, #11, #12 (4 items)
In Progress: #8 (1 item) ‚Üê Within limit
Done: #6, #7 (2 items)
```

### WIP Limit Rules
- **Engineering Tasks**: 1 per developer (focus)
- **User Stories**: 2 max (coordination)
- **Epic**: 1 (planning and oversight)

### Flow Optimization

**Scenario 1: Developer becomes available**
1. Check dependency matrix
2. Select highest priority available task
3. Ensure WIP limits not exceeded
4. Start work and update status

**Scenario 2: Task gets blocked**
1. Move to "Blocked" status (if available)
2. Document blocker in issue
3. Work on unblocking or switch to different task
4. Update team in standup

**Scenario 3: Task taking longer than expected**
1. Re-estimate remaining work
2. Consider breaking into smaller tasks
3. Pair programming to accelerate
4. Update stakeholders on impact

## Risk Management and Contingencies

### High-Risk Scenarios

**Risk 1: CloudflareLlama33JsonExtractor (#8) complexity higher than estimated**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (blocks everything else)
- **Mitigation**: Start early, pair programming, break into sub-tasks

**Risk 2: DI Configuration (#9) requires architecture changes**
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Review existing patterns, consult with team lead

**Risk 3: Performance benchmarking (#11) reveals issues**

- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Set clear performance targets, test early

### Contingency Plans

**If Week 1 slips:**
- Extend foundation phase by 2-3 days
