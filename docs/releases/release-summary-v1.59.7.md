# Release Summary: v1.59.7

## Overview

This release introduces comprehensive anti-hallucination measures to improve the reliability and accuracy of OCR processing. The improvements focus on detecting and properly handling minimal or invalid inputs, preventing the system from generating hallucinated data.

## Key Features

1. **Anti-Hallucination Detection**
   - Added `isValidInput` flag to both check and receipt schemas
   - Implemented detection of suspicious patterns common in hallucinated data
   - Added scoring system to identify potential hallucinations

2. **Schema Improvements**
   - Reduced required fields to only `confidence` to handle minimal inputs gracefully
   - Added support for flagging invalid inputs without erroring

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Updated system prompts with explicit anti-hallucination instructions
   - Added guidelines for handling minimal or invalid inputs
   - Emphasized accuracy over completeness in data extraction

4. **Confidence Scoring Enhancements**
   - Improved confidence calculation to account for input validity
   - Added multipliers to reduce confidence when potential hallucinations are detected
   - Integrated model's own confidence assessment in overall scoring

## Testing

The improvements were validated with various test images:

- **Minimal/Invalid Images**: Correctly identified as invalid (`isValidInput=false`) with low confidence scores
- **Valid Images**: Properly processed with high confidence scores and `isValidInput=true`

## Deployment

The changes have been deployed to the staging environment for further validation before production deployment.

## Breaking Changes

None. The new fields and behavior are backward compatible.

## Known Issues

None.

## Future Work

- Further refinement of hallucination detection patterns
- Additional testing with edge cases
- Potential integration with ML-based input validation
