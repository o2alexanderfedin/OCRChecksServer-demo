# Release Summary: v1.59.8

## Overview

This release resolves critical timeout issues that were occurring during JSON extraction phase of OCR processing. The improvements optimize retry strategies and timeout configurations based on AWS distributed systems best practices.

## Key Fixes

1. **Timeout Resolution**
   - Increased Cloudflare Worker execution limits from 30s to 60s for all environments
   - Optimized Mistral client timeout configurations to prevent hanging requests

2. **Retry Strategy Optimization**
   - Applied AWS best practices for exponential backoff
   - Reduced initial retry interval from 1000ms to 500ms for faster recovery
   - Reduced max retry interval from 10000ms to 8000ms to prevent long waits
   - Changed exponent from 1.8 to 2.0 for standard exponential backoff
   - Implemented fail-fast strategy with reduced max elapsed time (30s vs 45s)

3. **Performance Improvements**
   - Reduced individual request timeout from 30s to 25s to allow room for retries
   - Improved debug logging to avoid accessing private API client properties

## Problem Resolved

**Before**: JSON extraction requests were timing out after ~28 seconds, causing the entire OCR process to fail despite successful OCR text extraction.

**After**: Requests complete successfully in ~27 seconds with proper error recovery and retry mechanisms.

## Testing

The fixes have been validated with complex receipt processing that previously failed:
- OCR phase completes successfully (~5 seconds)
- JSON extraction phase completes successfully (~22 seconds)
- Total processing time within acceptable limits
- Anti-hallucination measures continue to work correctly

## Deployment

Changes deployed to all environments:
- Development: ✅ 
- Staging: ✅ (tested and validated)
- Production: ✅

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible.

## Technical Details

The retry strategy now follows AWS distributed systems best practices:
- Fast initial retry (500ms)
- Standard exponential backoff (2.0 exponent) 
- Reasonable max delay (8s)
- Fail-fast behavior (30s total retry window)

This ensures better performance and reliability while staying within Cloudflare Worker execution limits.
