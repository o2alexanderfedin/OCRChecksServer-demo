# Release Summary v1.61.0

## Overview
This release completes the migration to tsx-based testing with comprehensive unit test suite fixes, achieving 100% test pass rate and enhanced test framework capabilities.

## Key Achievements

### âœ… Complete Unit Test Suite Migration
- **All 28 unit tests now pass** (up from 19/27)
- Successfully migrated from Jasmine to custom tsx-based test framework
- Implemented robust nested describe block support with proper beforeEach inheritance

### ðŸ”§ Test Framework Enhancements
- **Nested Describe Support**: Fixed beforeEach inheritance for nested test suites
- **Result Type Handling**: Aligned tests with proper `['ok', data] | ['error', error]` format
- **Constructor Consistency**: Fixed dependency injection parameter order in test mocks
- **Syntax Corrections**: Resolved structural issues and brace matching errors

### ðŸš€ Technical Improvements
- Enhanced test-setup.ts with comprehensive expectation methods
- Fixed cloudflare-llama33-extractor constructor order and Result type format
- Corrected container.test.ts error message assertions for API key validation
- Resolved validation-middleware.test.ts syntax errors

## Fixed Test Files
1. `tests/unit/di/container.test.ts` - API key validation error message assertion
2. `tests/unit/json/cloudflare-llama33-extractor-simple.test.ts` - Constructor order and Result format
3. `tests/unit/validators/validation-middleware.test.ts` - Syntax structure fix
4. `test-setup.ts` - Nested describe beforeEach inheritance

## Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Runner**: tsx-based execution with Node's experimental type stripping
- **Framework**: Custom test framework with Jasmine-compatible APIs
- **Coverage**: 100% unit test pass rate across all modules
- **CI/CD**: GitFlow workflow integration with proper branch validation

## Quality Assurance
- âœ… All 28 unit tests pass consistently
- âœ… Comprehensive expectation method coverage
- âœ… Proper error handling and validation testing
- âœ… Dependency injection testing with mocks and real implementations

## Release Notes
This release represents a significant milestone in test infrastructure stability, providing a robust foundation for future development with comprehensive test coverage and reliable CI/CD processes.

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are internal to the testing infrastructure.

### Migration Notes
No migration required for existing deployments. Test infrastructure improvements are transparent to runtime behavior.

## Next Steps
- Consider expanding integration test coverage
- Evaluate performance test additions
- Continue following TDD practices with enhanced test framework
