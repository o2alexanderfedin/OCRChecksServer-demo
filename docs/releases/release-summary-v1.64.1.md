# Release Summary - Version 1.64.1

> **Release Date**: June 10, 2025  
> **Version**: 1.64.1  
> **Previous Version**: 1.64.0  
> **Type**: Patch Release - Bug Fix

## Overview

Version 1.64.1 is a critical patch release that fixes environment URL configuration issues in the smoke testing infrastructure. This release ensures that smoke tests correctly target their intended environments, providing accurate deployment verification.

## Bug Fixes

### üîß Smoke Test Environment URL Corrections

#### Problem Resolved
The production smoke test was incorrectly configured to hit the development environment URL for all environment targets, causing:
- **Incorrect Version Reporting**: Production smoke tests showed version 1.63.0 instead of the actual deployed version 1.64.0
- **Environment Confusion**: All environment tests (production, staging, dev) were hitting the same dev URL
- **Deployment Verification Issues**: False negative results when verifying production deployments

#### Root Cause
Environment URL configuration in `scripts/production-smoke-test.ts` had all environments pointing to the dev worker URL:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
const environments = {
  production: 'https://ocr-checks-worker-dev.af-4a0.workers.dev',  // Wrong!
  staging: 'https://ocr-checks-worker-dev.af-4a0.workers.dev',     // Wrong!
  dev: 'https://ocr-checks-worker-dev.af-4a0.workers.dev',
  local: 'http://localhost:8787'
};
```

#### Solution Implemented
Fixed environment URLs to target correct worker endpoints:
```typescript
// AFTER (correct)
const environments = {
  production: 'https://ocr-checks-worker.af-4a0.workers.dev',        // Fixed!
  staging: 'https://ocr-checks-worker-staging.af-4a0.workers.dev',   // Fixed!
  dev: 'https://ocr-checks-worker-dev.af-4a0.workers.dev',
  local: 'http://localhost:8787'
};
```

## Verification Results

### Before Fix
```
Target: https://ocr-checks-worker-dev.af-4a0.workers.dev (production environment)
‚úì Health Check: Server version: 1.63.0  ‚ùå Wrong version!
```

### After Fix
```
Target: https://ocr-checks-worker.af-4a0.workers.dev (production environment)
‚úì Health Check: Server version: 1.64.1  ‚úÖ Correct version!
```

## Technical Impact

### üéØ Improved Testing Accuracy
- **Correct Environment Targeting**: Each environment test now hits the correct worker URL
- **Accurate Version Verification**: Smoke tests now report the actual deployed version
- **Reliable Deployment Verification**: CI/CD pipelines can now accurately verify deployments

### üîç Enhanced Debugging
- **Clear Environment Identification**: Test output now shows correct target URLs
- **Proper Version Tracking**: Version mismatches are now accurately detected
- **Environment-Specific Testing**: Each environment can be tested independently

## Files Modified

### Fixed Files
- `scripts/production-smoke-test.ts`: Corrected environment URL configuration (lines 43-46)

## Testing and Verification

### Smoke Test Verification
All smoke tests now pass with correct environment targeting:
```
‚úì Health Check: Server version: 1.64.1
‚úì Check Processing: Received check data with confidence: 0.68
‚úì Receipt Processing: Received receipt data with confidence: 0.68
‚úì Universal Processing: API flow working - processed as check
‚úì Error Handling: Received proper error response: 429

5/5 tests passed
```

### Environment Testing
- **Production**: `https://ocr-checks-worker.af-4a0.workers.dev` ‚úÖ
- **Staging**: `https://ocr-checks-worker-staging.af-4a0.workers.dev` ‚úÖ  
- **Development**: `https://ocr-checks-worker-dev.af-4a0.workers.dev` ‚úÖ
- **Local**: `http://localhost:8787` ‚úÖ

## Benefits for Operations

### üöÄ Deployment Confidence
- **Accurate Verification**: Deployments can be verified against correct environments
- **Version Validation**: Deployed versions are correctly identified and validated
- **Environment Isolation**: Each environment is tested independently

### üõ† Maintenance Improvements
